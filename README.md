> :open_hands: A community-led initiative to help Ideator kickstarting their open-source journey by completing Hacktoberfest'21 challenge.

For many working with innovative project, good ideas or cool projects aren't the limiting factor. Time is. But there are a lot of different people out there with various levels of experience and background. Some want to create Projects, but don't know where to start or what to create. Why don't we solve both of these problems or suggest ideas to solve each other ideas ?

This repo tries to collect ideas for __Projects__ that are up for grabs. It's much better for a project to see the light of day instead of slowly dying in a dusty Reminders-list in some way-too-small iCloud storage.

**Let's show what open in Open Source means by creating a welcoming, inclusive and supportive community for all that want to be involved.** 


## What to do?

1. Add any project idea, piece of code or script of your choice you wish to share in this repository or any innovation you have in the current idea.
**Add your projects under the respective tech stack folder only**

  - Tech Stacks

      * [`Mobile app`]()
      * [`IoT`]()
      * [`Web app`]()
      * [`Frontend/UI`]()
      * [`AI/ML`]()
      * [`APIs/Backend`]()
      * [`Voice Assistant`]()
      * [`Developer Tooling`]()
      * [`Extension/Plugin/Add-On`]()
      * [`Design/UX`]()
      * [`AR/VR`]()
      * [`Bots`]()
      * [`Security`]()
      * [`Blockchain`]()
      * [`Futuristic Tech/Something Unique`]()



2. **Update <your github usernmae>.md file available in respective tech stack project folder with the description of your project.**

- *Project Heading*
- *Project subtopics or tags*
- *Motivation*
- *Description*
- *References*
- *Additional Resources*

  
  
It can be any of any length and can be any number of scripts,github repo links, just **add a folder with your projects name** if you have many resources to support your idea.



## Support

My hope is that we can get more people involved with learning the customary behavior and continuing to drive the open community forward.

```javascript

if (isAwesome) {
    // thanks in advance :p
    starThisRepository();
}

```
